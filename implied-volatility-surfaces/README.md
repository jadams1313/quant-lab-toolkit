# Implied Volatility 

# Usage 
A deeper look into implied volatilities using the Black Scholes Merton model. This repository serves as an exploratory avenue for examining how we derive volaties regardless of historical performances. 

# Future Work
I plan to implement many key concepts to better understand volatility from a risk-management persepective. The goal is to have exploratory notebooks on a multitude of topics such as predicting future implied volatilities from historical data.
